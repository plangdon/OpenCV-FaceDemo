# OpenCV-FaceDemo
Using OpenCV to tag faces using Node.js

The application uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), with the [Viola-Jones object detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework). 

In order to run OpenCV from Node.js, it uses the [opencv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv) package.
